# Quantum-support-vector-machine

This is the quantum version of the support vector machine 

This model is desgiend using custom feature map and custom quantum kernel

The quantum kernel is designed using SWAP test

The data set used in MNIST_784 digits data set which contains images of digits from 0 to 9

The model achieved a accuracy of 58%
